# Set-up

The following set-up instructions assume that you are working on a machine with Ubuntu 16.04. If you're using a different distro, use this as a guideline only, and search up the instructions relevant to your distro at each step.

## Install the Main Tools

### Zsh

```
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install zsh
```

Set Zsh as the default shell

```
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

### Tmux

Note: we require at least v2.3 for true color support.

```
cd ~/Downloads

sudo apt-get install -y libevent-dev libncurses-dev make

wget https://github.com/tmux/tmux/releases/download/2.3/tmux-2.3.tar.gz
tar -xvzf tmux-2.3.tar.gz

cd tmux-2.3/
./configure && make
sudo make install
```

Feel free to delete the tmux-2.3 directory and the tmux-2.3.tar.gz file after finishing installation.

### Vim

Note: we require at least Vim 8 to use some of the plugins.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/vim
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install vim
```

Make sure to open `vim` at least once to check that the correct version (Vim 8) has been installed.

We also need to have support for Python scripting (for YouCompleteMe). Run `vim --version | grep python` and ensure that there is a `+` before either Python 2 or 3. If you don't, you will need to [compile vim from source](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe/wiki/Building-Vim-from-source) (don't worry, it's easy).

## Set up the Home Directory

### Symlinks

Clone the repository, then create the appropriate symlinks for your dotfiles:

```
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/zsh/zshrc ~/.zshrc
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/tmux/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/git/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/ssh/config ~/.ssh/config
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/bash/bashrc ~/.bashrc
```

### Directories

Create the `Workspace` and `Quicklinks` directories in the home directory if they don't exist yet.

## Set up External Dependencies

### General/Common

* [One Dark Theme for Gnome Terminal](https://github.com/denysdovhan/one-gnome-terminal)

    ```
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denysdovhan/gnome-terminal-one/master/one-dark.sh && . one-dark.sh
    ```

    You may want to make a copy of the resulting terminal profile and tweak the colors a bit to suit your liking.

* [Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) (for the Powerline strips in Vim and Tmux)

    ```
    sudo apt-get install fonts-powerline
    ```

    Note: while this will correct the incorrect/missing symbols problem, you may still need to explicitly download the specific Powerline fonts you wish to use.

    To explicitly download and install certain fonts, just do the following:

   * Download the font file (usually a .ttf or .otf file) from the Powerline Fonts repository
   * Copy it into ~/.fonts (create the directory if it's missing)
   * `sudo fc-cache -fv`

       [//]: # "How to install fonts on Linux: https://www.blackmoreops.com/2014/07/31/install-fonts-on-linux/"

       Then simply configure the terminal's settings to use the particular font you want.

       For our case in particular, we like to use **Droid Sans Mono for Powerline Bold** (Size 10), and we also prefer to turn off "Allow bold text" in the terminal settings.

### Zsh

* [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen.git ~/.zgen
    ```

* Tree

    ```
    sudo apt-get install tree
    ```

* Nemo File Explorer (optional)

    ```
    sudo apt-get install nemo
    ```

    If you don't want to use Nemo, make sure to change the file explorer used by the `open` alias in the Zsh configuration file.

### Tmux

* [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm
    ```

    Hit `<PREFIX>-I` while in a Tmux session to install plugins.

### Vim

* Clang (including LibClang) and ClangTidy (for YouCompleteMe and Neomake)

    ```
    sudo apt-get install clang
    sudo apt-get install clang-tidy
    ```

* [Exuberant Ctags](https://github.com/jakedouglas/exuberant-ctags) (for indexing language objects; useful for things like Go-to-Definition)

    ```
    sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags
    ```

* [SilverSearcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) (for speeding up indexing in CtrlP)

    ```
    sudo apt-get install silversearcher-ag
    ```

    Ensure that `ag` exists in `/usr/bin/`. Also, try invoking `ag` in the terminal at least once.


* YouCompleteMe Setup

    Setting up YouCompleteMe is actually fairly straightforward; simply follow the instructions for your OS [here](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#ubuntu-linux-x64) (Ubuntu in our case).

    The short set-up guide covers which external dependencies you need to install. Make sure these dependencies are installed before letting vim-plug build and install YouCompleteMe. If you accidentally let vim-plug attempt the build before installing the dependencies, simply delete the `~/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe` directory, then open vim and enter `:PlugInstall` to retry the installation (this is, in general, a fool-proof way to reinstall YouCompleteMe any time).

    The short guide also includes instructions on how to install YouCompleteMe with semantic completions for supported languages on top of the base YouCompleteMe installation, as well as the dependencies you will need to install for each language (note that for C/C++, we already installed its depedency, `libclang`).

    That's it. You don't actually need to refer to the [full installation guide](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#full-installation-guide) unless you're on a different distro or something goes wrong with the installation.

    Lastly, read the sections for the languages you plan to use with semantic completion in the [user guide](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#user-guide) to see set-up steps specific to that language (note that C/C++ is already taken care of for you via the `.ycm_extra_conf.py`).

* LaTeX Setup (optional)

    [//]: # "Getting Started with LaTeX on Linux (the basics): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1017055/get-started-with-latex-on-linux"

    [//]: # "Compile LaTeX doc manually on Linux: https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/16884/compiling-a-latex-document-manually"

    TeXLive 2016 (a LaTeX distro):
    ```
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/texlive-2016
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install texlive
    ```

    Latexmk (LaTeX compiler used by VimTeX):
    ```
    sudo apt-get install latexmk
    ```

    Zathura (for viewing the PDF doc; supports closer integration with VimTeX)
    ```
    sudo apt-get install zathura
    ```

    Xdotool (required by VimTeX for performing forward searches on Zathura)
    ```
    sudo apt-get install xdotool
    ```

    To verify that your set-up works, try compiling this [sample LaTeX file](http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/TypicalInput.html).

    If you're trying (and failing) to compile an existing LaTeX project, you might be lacking some of the LaTeX packages it's using.

## Done

That's all!
